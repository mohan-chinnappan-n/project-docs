## Network Latency

**Network latency** refers to the time it takes for data to travel from its source to its destination across a computer network. It is often measured in milliseconds (ms) and represents the delay or lag that occurs during data transmission. Latency can affect the performance and responsiveness of various online activities, such as web browsing, online gaming, video streaming, and real-time communication.

Network latency can be caused by several factors, including:

1. **Propagation Delay:** This is the time it takes for a signal to travel from the sender to the receiver. It is influenced by the physical distance between the two points and the speed of light in the transmission medium (e.g., fiber optic cable or copper wire).

2. **Transmission Delay:** This delay is related to the time it takes to push data onto the network medium. It is influenced by the bandwidth of the network link and the size of the data packets being transmitted.

3. **Processing Delay:** This delay occurs when network devices, such as routers and switches, process and forward data packets. The time taken for these devices to examine and make decisions about packet routing can contribute to latency.

4. **Queueing Delay:** In cases where network traffic exceeds the capacity of a network device, data packets may be placed in a queue and have to wait for their turn to be transmitted. This queueing delay can increase latency.

5. **Jitter:** Jitter refers to variations in latency over time. It can be caused by network congestion, fluctuating traffic patterns, or other factors. High jitter can result in inconsistent and choppy performance for real-time applications like voice and video calls.

Low network latency is crucial for applications that require real-time or near-real-time communication, such as online gaming, video conferencing, and financial trading systems. To minimize latency, network administrators and engineers use various techniques and technologies, including optimizing network architecture, using faster transmission mediums, **reducing the number of hops** in the network, and implementing Quality of Service (QoS) policies to prioritize critical traffic.

**Reducing network latency** helps improve the overall user experience and ensures that data-intensive applications perform as expected.
